During my internship at Cyber Struggle, I was tasked with building a vulnerable mobile application using Java and Android Studio as part of a comprehensive learning experience in mobile application security. The main objective of the internship was to deepen my understanding of mobile security vulnerabilities and to gain hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating them.

Throughout the internship, I developed an Android mobile application (Cyber Struggle) deliberately designed with multiple security flaws, such as unsecure authentication bypass, code injection vulnerabilities, insufficient session management, reverse engineering, and code tampering. This exercise allowed me to simulate real-world security scenarios and apply security principles to vulnerable code.

## My task and responsiblity during the internship
During my internship at Cyber Struggle, I was assigned various tasks and responsibilities that aimed to strengthen my understanding of mobile application security. The primary objective was to build a vulnerable mobile application and assess the security weaknesses in the app. This project was a key part of the company’s training in developing secure applications while understanding how attackers exploit vulnerabilities. Below is a comprehensive overview of the tasks and responsibilities I handled throughout my internship:

## 1. Development of a Vulnerable Mobile Application

One of my main tasks was to develop a mobile application using Java in Android Studio with intentionally embedded security vulnerabilities. The purpose of this project was to create a controlled environment where real-world mobile security weaknesses could be analyzed. I was responsible for designing the app’s architecture, developing the code, and implementing several vulnerable features.

Key areas of vulnerability that I focused on include:
•	Unsecure Authentication Bypass: I implemented insecure authentication methods to allow unauthorized users to bypass the login system.
•	Code Injection Vulnerabilities: I embedded input fields that were susceptible to SQL Injection and other code injection attacks.
•	Malicious Intent Filters: I configured intent filters that could be hijacked by attackers to launch malicious activities.
•	Insufficient Session Management: I demonstrated poor session handling by allowing session hijacking and improper user logout mechanisms.
•	Reverse Engineering and Code Tampering: The app was built with obfuscation weaknesses, allowing reverse engineering and tampering of the code.

## 2. Researching and Implementing Mobile Security Vulnerabilities

I was responsible for researching common vulnerabilities in mobile applications, particularly those related to authentication, session management, and code injection. This research helped guide the development of the vulnerable app and ensured that it demonstrated realistic attack scenarios. I also conducted a thorough analysis of how these vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers and documented the corresponding security flaws.

Specific tasks included:
•	Researching and implementing vulnerabilities like Insecure Data Storage, Weak Cryptography, and Improper Access Control.
•	Simulating attacker strategies for reverse engineering and tampering with the application.
•	Testing how vulnerabilities could be exploited using popular tools like Frida, Burp Suite, and dex2jar.

## 3. Collaboration with Cybersecurity Teams

As part of my internship, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Cyber Struggle's cybersecurity teams. I worked closely with security experts in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and mobile penetration testing. My responsibilities included:
•	Participating in meetings with cybersecurity professionals to discuss the app’s vulnerabilities and ways to address them.
•	Conducting code reviews to identify additional weaknesses or areas for improvement.
•	Learning from the team's expertise on secure coding practices and application hardening techniques.

## 4. Documentation and Reporting

A critical part of my responsibility was documenting the vulnerabilities found within the application and preparing detailed reports on how they could be exploited. This included:

•	Writing technical documentation that outlined each vulnerability, how it was implemented, and the associated risks.
•	Preparing a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate how attackers could leverage each vulnerability to compromise the app.
•	Summarizing my findings in weekly progress reports and presenting them to my supervisor for feedback and guidance.

## 5. Security Remediation and Recommendations

Beyond simply developing a vulnerable application, I was also tasked with proposing solutions to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. This part of my work involved:
•	Identifying secure coding practices that could prevent authentication bypass, code injection, and reverse engineering.
•	Proposing session management best practices, such as proper token handling and session expiration mechanisms.
•	Recommending encryption and code obfuscation techniques to secure sensitive data and prevent reverse engineering.

## 6. Testing the Application in Vulnerability Assessments

To further enhance my knowledge, I was also involved in testing the app using penetration testing techniques. This helped me understand how hackers think and operate. My testing responsibilities included:
•	Running automated vulnerability scans on the app using tools like MobSF and Burp Suite Mobile Scanner.
•	Conducting manual penetration tests to validate the presence of vulnerabilities and evaluate how they could be exploited.
•	Performing reverse engineering of the app’s APK to analyze the exposed code and data.

## Summary of Responsibilities

•	Designing and developing a vulnerable mobile application with multiple security flaws.
•	Researching mobile security vulnerabilities and implementing them in the application.
•	Collaborating with the Cyber Struggle team to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
•	Documenting vulnerabilities, writing technical reports, and presenting findings.
•	Conducting penetration tests and reverse engineering the application to identify weaknesses.
•	Proposing remediation strategies and secure coding practices to prevent common mobile security issues.

This experience allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of mobile security vulnerabilities, hands-on development, and testing, as well as the best practices needed to build secure mobile applications. It also enhanced my collaboration, research, and technical reporting skills, all of which are crucial in the field of cybersecurity.
